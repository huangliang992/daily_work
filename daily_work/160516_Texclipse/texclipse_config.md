 Next,*select the Viewer settings page*. You must set paths of the used viewers. As with the LaTeX distribution at step 2, set the correct path for the viewer you are going to use. Also make sure that the viewer is registered to the right format (for example, pdf for acroread)
Note also, that the plugin uses the first viewer on the list that matches the current output format
