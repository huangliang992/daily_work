## 1. 基于关系抽取的需求文本自动建模方法研究与实现

论文里面我所关注的几个点：

自动建模工具（有没有接口可以调用？）

实体特征的提取（包括属性方法等），实体之间关系的抽取


## 2. Model Metrication in MOVA: A Metamodel-Based Approach using OCL
实则是将ocl转化为uml类图，并没有涉及到从自然语言的需求中提取信息

MOVA [24] is a modeling and validation tool: it allows the users to draw UML
class and object diagrams; write and check OCL constraints; write and evaluate
OCL queries; define OCL operations to be used in constraints and queries; and write and evaluate OCL metrics.

## 3. From user requirements to UML class diagram

1. GATE API：can provides a set of natural language analysis tools which can
take English language text input and give as a result the base forms of words, their parts of speech, etc., and mark up the structure of sentences in terms of phrases and word dependencies, and mention which noun phrases refer to the same entities. In other words, GATE offers the foundational building blocks for higher level text understanding applications.

整个的流程如下所示

2. 他们提出的启发式学习的规则    
实体提取规则

		Rule 1: “All nouns are converted to entity types” [7]

		Rule 2: “A gerund may indicate an entity type which is converted from a relationship type” [6]

		Rule 3: a specialization’s relationship between entities: sentence’s structure “is a” can relate two nouns A and B to one another. [8]

		Rule 4: A noun such as “database”, “record”, “system”,“company”, “information”, “organization” and “detail” may not be considered as a relevant candidate for an entity type since it shows the business environment and logically have to be not included in the entity’s category [9].

		Rule 5: every proper noun (Person name, Location name …) is ignored to be a class.

属性提取规则

		Rule 6: A noun such as “vehicle_number”, “group_no”, “person_id” and “room_type” may refer to an attribute type[10]

		Rule 7: The genitive case, also called possessive case, often shows ownership. Hence, it can be used to extract attributes[7]

		Rule 8: If consecutive nouns are present, check the last noun. If it is not one of the words in set S where S = {number, no, code, date, type, volume, birth, id, address, name}, most likely it is an entity type. Else it may indicate an attribute type.[9]

		Rule 9: A noun phrase succeeding the “has/have” verb phrase may indicate the presence of attribute types [10] 

关系的提取

		Rule 10: A transitive verb can be a candidate for relationship type [6]

		Rule 11: A verb followed by a preposition such as “in”, “on”,‘to” and “by” can indicate a relationship type[9]”.

		Rule 12: “if a verb is equal to one of the following list {“include”, “involve”, “consists of”, contain, “comprise”,“divided to”, “embrace”}, therefore, this relationship can be aggregation or composition”.


通过ontology（本体论）来精炼（具体方法没讲）

## 对比
1. 国内13年的那边论文，和国外15年的这篇，都有对CM-Builder 和 LIDA这两个工具的比较，下面搜这两个工具看一下。
